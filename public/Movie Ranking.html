 <h1> The Best Movies According to Prince </h1>
 <h2> My top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>

 <hr/>

 <h3> Fast and Furious </h3>
 <p> It is one of  my favorite movies because I love movies with actions; <br/>
especially when cars are involved, technologies and police cases to solve. <br/> </p>

<h3> Naruto </h3>
<p> It is my favorite anime because it is the first anime that I watched, when i was a kid. <br/> 
What I like about Naruto, is the story behind it and the lessons that we can learn from it. <br/> </p>

<h3> Nikita </h3>
<p> Nikita, it is an american action serie, I really like it<br/>
at a point that I can finish it and rewatch it .</p>
