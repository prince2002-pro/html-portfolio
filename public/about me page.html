<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi! I’m Prince Visanguliryo a passionate and versatile Data Scientist, Analyst, and Web <br/>
  Designer with a strong technical foundation in data science, web development, artificial <br/> 
  intelligence, industrial electronics, and automotive mechanics.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  I’m proficient in a wide range of tools and technologies including Python, SQL, JavaScript, <br/>
  React, Node.js, Tableau, Power BI, PostgreSQL, Java, HTML, CSS, and C++. I specialize in <br/>
  turning data into actionable insights to optimize operations, solve real-world problems, and  <br/>
  support business growth. In addition, I have a solid background in graphic design, allowing  <br/>
  me to blend analytical thinking with creative presentation.<br/>
</p>
<h2>My Journey</h2>
<p>
  I was born and raised in Goma, a beautiful town in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. <br/>
  I earned my high school diploma in Industrial Electronics from École du Cinquantenaire. After  <br/>
  high school, I moved to Kinshasa, where I spent over a year learning English at CALI (Congo  <br/>
  American Language Institute), one of the top English centers in DRC. During that time, I also <br/>
  pursued hands-on training in automotive mechanics, driven by my curiosity about how cars work.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  My university journey began in 2022 when I moved to Kenya to join United States International  <br/>
  University-Africa (USIU-A),  where I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Data Science  <br/>
  and Analytics. Since then, I’ve continued to grow by exploring web development, graphic design,  <br/>
  piano playing (still learning!), and enrolling in various online courses to continuously upskill.<br/>
</p>

<h2>My work and Vision</h2>
<p>
  In February 2024, I launched my own company Phoenix Business to merge my passion for <br/> 
  entrepreneurship with my technical knowledge. I enjoy building solutions that address   <br/>
  real-world challenges and contribute positively to people’s lives. I’m committed, goal-driven, <br/>
  and constantly learning from both successes and setbacks to become better every day.<br/>
</p>

<h2>What Inspire Me</h2>
<p> 
  I’m deeply inspired by innovation, global collaboration, and the power of creativity. Being fluent<br/>
  in English, French, and Swahili, and living in a multicultural environment like USIU has taught me <br/>
  how to engage with diverse perspectives and build a global network. Oh, and I love music.<br/>
  It’s at the top of my hobby list. I sing and play the piano; music is my escape, my joy, and my way of<br/>
  expressing emotion.<br/>
